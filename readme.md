# Advent Of Code 2015
I started programming the advent of code challenges back in 2015, got up to around day 7 and then stopped because of other commitments. I've decided to give it another go, with a twist - each challenge will be implemented in four different languages - Python, Java, C++, and Go. I've known Java the longest, used Python the most (its so simple it feels like its cheating), and have been gaining proficiency in C++ over the past years (it's just a matter of knowing the libraries well at this point). Go, however, is very new to me. My favorite way to get acquainted with a new language's idioms and syntax is through solving programming puzzles. It's also my favorite way to move beyond acquaintance and gain a better understanding of idiomatic and efficient use of the syntax, structures, and libraries of the languages I "know". Thus, a year and a half after the livelihood of these coding challenges, I'm gonna have at them. I plan on doing the newer 2016 challenges as well (and 2017 when it comes out), but for the sake of completeness I must start here.
